# Product Image Cleaner [M2]
**hs/module-image-clean**

Deleting a product in Magento does not delete the images stored on server. These images will probably stay there forever clogging up your disk space.

Hungersoftâ€™s [Product Image Cleaner](https://www.hungersoft.com/p/magento2-product-image-cleaner) extension allows you to delete these unused product images easily from your Magento admin.

## Installation

```sh
composer config repositories.hs-module-image-clean vcs https://github.com/hungersoft/module-image-clean.git
composer require hs/module-image-clean

php bin/magento module:enable HS_ImageClean
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
```
